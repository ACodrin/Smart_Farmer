# Smart Farmer
### Description
Smart Farmer is a puzzle game that I had to make alongside my classmate, Leru Stefan, in my first semester at Introduction in Programming. It's a simple singleplayer game, with a simple objective: to separate each animal type with the given fences in different meadows. The game is made with C and C++ programming languages and it also contains the WinBGIm graphic library. The code is a bit rough and kind of confusing, but it is my first Computer Science project.
